## Overview

[Blackbox](https://blackbox.xcode.cx/) is a powerful AI-driven debugging tool for any language. It allows AI to seamlessly set breakpoints, start/stop debug sessions, inspect variables, and navigate code using [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) tools. It works out-of-the-box with any Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) compatible debugger, including PHP, Node.js, Python, Go, C/C++, Java, and more!

## ✨ Key Features (Tool Contract)

All IDE implementations expose the same consistent set of tools defined in [`schema/tools.json`](schema/tools.json):

| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Set Breakpoint | Place a breakpoint at any file and line, with an optional condition or log message. | debug |
| Remove Breakpoint | Remove an existing breakpoint by file path and line number. | debug |
| List Breakpoints | List all active breakpoints — file, line, condition, and hit count. | debug |
| Start Session | Start a debug session for any language — PHP, Node, Python, Go, C++, and more. | debug |
| Stop Session | Stop the currently active debug session cleanly. | debug |
| Evaluate Expression | Run any expression in the current debug context — call functions, inspect values. | debug |
| Get Variables | Fetch all in-scope variables when paused; expand nested objects and arrays. | debug |
| Get Stack Trace | Inspect the full call stack — file, line number, and function name per frame. | debug |
| Open File | Open any file in the editor and optionally scroll to a specific line. | editor |
| List Open Files | List all open editor tabs with their active and unsaved-changes status. | editor |
| Find File | Search for files in the workspace by glob pattern. | workspace |
| Get Diagnostics | Pull errors and warnings from every language server; filter by severity. | workspace |
