## Releasing (maintainers)

Each VS Code extension version is a tag `vscode-v<version>`, a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/akash-aman/blackbox/releases) and an entry in [`editors/vscode/CHANGELOG.md`](editors/vscode/CHANGELOG.md).

1. Bump `version` in `editors/vscode/package.json` (`npm version <x.y.z> --no-git-tag-version`).
2. In `editors/vscode/CHANGELOG.md`, rename `## Unreleased` (where changes collect, one bullet per user-visible change) to `## <x.y.z> (Pre-release) — <YYYY-MM-DD>`. Leave out `(Pre-release)` for a stable release. Check it with `node scripts/release-notes.js <x.y.z>`.
3. Merge to `main`, then tag that commit and push the tag:
   ```sh
   git tag vscode-v<x.y.z> && git push origin vscode-v<x.y.z>
   ```
4. The **Release VS Code Extension** workflow does the rest:
   - checks the tag, `package.json` and changelog agree;
   - runs the unit and VS Code tests;
   - packages the `.vsix` once;
   - creates the GitHub Release with the changelog notes and the `.vsix` attached;
   - publishes that same `.vsix` to the VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX.

   If a check fails, nothing is released: fix it, delete the tag, and tag again.

To try the pipeline on a branch without releasing anything, run the workflow by hand from the Actions tab: it builds, tests and packages only.
