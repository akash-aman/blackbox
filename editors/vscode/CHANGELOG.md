# Changelog

All notable changes to the Blackbox VS Code extension. Each version is also a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/akash-aman/blackbox/releases) (tag `vscode-v<version>`) with these notes and the packaged `.vsix`.

Releases are published by pushing a `vscode-v<version>` tag; CI refuses to release a version without an entry here. Changes collect under `## Unreleased`; at release time that heading becomes `## <version> (Pre-release) — <date>` (leave out `(Pre-release)` for a stable release).

## 0.5.1 — 2026-09-30

- **Launcher can't be downgraded:** `~/.blackbox/blackbox-mcp.js` now records which version wrote it. An editor with an older Blackbox leaves a newer launcher alone; a rollback replaces it once the newer install is gone.
- **No lost install records:** each install keeps its own file in `~/.blackbox/installs/`, so windows of several editors starting at once can't overwrite each other. The 0.5.0 `installs.json` is still read.
- Builds run from source (F5) are no longer recorded as the server MCP clients use.
- **Copy MCP Server Configuration** writes the absolute path of your `node` (found through your login shell), since apps started from the Dock often don't have nvm's `node` on their PATH.
- A working directory of `/` or your home folder no longer counts as containing every project. When nothing matches, the editor the session was started from decides if it has one window (e.g. Antigravity's agent, which starts with cwd `/`).
- A registry entry whose socket is gone is treated as dead, so a reused process id can't make a closed window look alive.
- **Windows:** the MCP server starts without waiting for a slow PowerShell process lookup (now done only when needed); named pipe names include a random part, so other users can't claim a window's pipe first; a closing window frees its pipe at once.
- CI runs the tests on Linux, macOS and Windows before every release.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-09-30

- **First stable release.** Until now every version was a pre-release, so a normal install, or "Switch to Release Version" in Antigravity and other Open VSX editors, found no version to install.
- **Version-independent MCP launcher:** every activation, in any editor, records its install and keeps `~/.blackbox/blackbox-mcp.js` up to date. Point MCP clients at `node ~/.blackbox/blackbox-mcp.js`; it starts the newest installed Blackbox server, so configs no longer break when an editor updates the extension. New command **Blackbox: Copy MCP Server Configuration** copies a ready-to-paste entry.
- Messages say "editor window" instead of "VS Code window", since windows can be Cursor, Antigravity and other VS Code-based editors.
- A selected window that reloads is found again only in the same editor. Before, with a project open in two editors, reloading the selected Antigravity window could silently switch the session to the VS Code window with the same folder.
- `debug_run_to_line` reports `reachedTarget` correctly when the file is given through a symlink (e.g. WordPress `wp/` pointing at `wordpress-develop/src/`).

## 0.4.1 (Pre-release) — 2026-09-30

- `debug_start` no longer hangs when the editor is waiting on a prompt before starting the debugger (saving unsaved files first because of `debug.saveBeforeStart`, a pre-launch task, a picker). After 20s it returns an explanation, naming any unsaved untitled files, and says to answer the prompt and then call `debug_wait_for_stop`.
- `debug_start` fails at once in a workspace in Restricted Mode, where the editor disables debugging, instead of waiting.
- Breakpoint changes now wait for every debug session to confirm them, not just the first. With Node (js-debug), the child session that runs the program could miss a breakpoint just added, e.g. by `debug_run_to_line`, and run past it.

## 0.4.0 (Pre-release) — 2026-09-30

- **New tools:** `debug_set_function_breakpoint`, `debug_toggle_breakpoints` (enable/disable without removing), `debug_run_to_line` (temporary breakpoint, always removed), `debug_list_threads`, `debug_set_variable` (via the adapter's setVariable or setExpression), `debug_get_source_context`.
- `hitCondition` on `debug_set_breakpoint`; `functions` on `debug_remove_breakpoint`; function breakpoints and hit conditions in `debug_list_breakpoints`.
- `threadId` and `frameId` on `debug_evaluate`, `debug_get_variables`, `debug_inspect` and `debug_watch`; `threadId` and `levels` on `debug_get_stack_trace`.
- The result notes when the active debug adapter doesn't support function breakpoints or hit conditions.
- **VS Code chat:** all 31 tools (everything except `ide_*`) are now available as `#` tools; 11 were missing before. Declarations are generated from `schema/tools.json` (`npm run sync:tools`).
- One tool list (`tools/catalog.ts`) feeds both the MCP bridge and VS Code chat, and a contract test keeps MCP, the schema, `package.json` and the catalog identical.
- **Tool descriptions for AI:** every tool description was rewritten to say what it does, when to use it instead of related tools, what it returns and its caveats (e.g. `debug_evaluate` runs code). All 75 parameters now have descriptions with formats and defaults (22 had none). MCP clients and VS Code chat now get the same text.
- **MCP annotations:** every tool has a title and `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint`, so clients can tell read-only calls (12 tools) from destructive ones (5).
- The MCP server serves `schema/tools.json` directly and checks arguments against it, so a wrong type fails with a clear message (e.g. `arguments.line must be a number`). `debug_start` accepts any extra launch configuration property.
- `debug_wait_for_stop {next: true}` waits for a new pause while another thread is already paused (e.g. a second PHP request).
- Paused threads are tracked per thread, so `debug_list_threads` marks every paused PHP request, not just the latest.
- The old shared `/tmp/blackbox/` folder is no longer read; windows on 0.2.0 or older need the update to be seen.

## 0.3.0 (Pre-release) — 2026-09-30

- **Several editors:** windows record their editor (VS Code, Cursor, Antigravity, …), version and extension version. `ide_list_windows` shows them, `ide_select_window` accepts `app`, and labels name the editor when several are running.
- **Launch-aware routing:** when the same project is open in several windows, calls go to the window the AI was started from (chat panel or integrated terminal via `BLACKBOX_WINDOW`), then to windows of the launching editor.
- **Per-user IPC directory:** sockets moved to `/tmp/blackbox-<uid>/`, created private and checked for ownership. This fixes the bridge failing for a second user on the same machine, and stops other users planting fake windows. The old `/tmp/blackbox/` is still read for 0.2.0 windows.
- **New tools:** `debug_wait_for_stop`, `debug_get_output` (program output and logpoint messages), `debug_set_exception_breakpoints`.
- `debug_get_output` keeps responses small: entries over 2,000 characters are shortened, a response stays under about 50,000 characters, and `match` filters by text. Adapters such as php-debug with `"log": true` write megabytes of protocol trace to the output.
- **`debug_start {configName}`** starts a launch configuration by name, with all its settings. Launch configurations are now read through VS Code, which also fixes values containing `//` (e.g. URLs) being cut off.
- Step and pause tools report where they stopped; all stepping and inspection tools accept `threadId`. Thread selection prefers the paused thread, which fixes concurrent PHP requests and adapters using thread id 0.
- Commands go to the paused debug session, and `debug_stop` stops the whole session tree (fixes Node/js-debug child sessions).
- Adding or removing breakpoints waits for the debug adapter to confirm, so a following continue can't hit a removed breakpoint.
- `npm test` works again on current VS Code (`@vscode/test-electron` 3.1).

## 0.2.0 (Pre-release) — 2026-09-30

- New MCP tools `ide_list_windows` and `ide_select_window`: an AI session can see every VS Code window, its folders and its debugger state (running, or stopped at file:line), and choose the window it controls.
- Calls no longer fall back silently to the last-focused window. When the window cannot be chosen from the working directory, the call fails with the list of windows so the AI can select one.
- A selected window stays selected across reloads; if it closes, calls fail instead of moving to another window.
- Results name the window (`[window: …]`) when more than one is running.

## 0.1.3 (Pre-release) — 2026-09-28

- Fix "IPC connection failed" when more than one VS Code window is open. Each window now has its own socket under `/tmp/blackbox/`, and closing or reloading one window no longer disconnects the others.
- The MCP server routes each call to the window that owns its working directory, and retries briefly while a window is starting.
- The bridge recreates its socket if the file is deleted.
- Tool failures are now reported as MCP errors, and slow tools such as `debug_start` get longer time limits.

## 0.1.2 (Pre-release) — 2026-05-04

- README: the MCP server configuration example uses `<user>` and `<version>` placeholders, with a filled-in macOS example.

## 0.1.1 (Pre-release) — 2026-04-25

- README: new overview, features section and logo.
- Added a Code of Conduct, contributing guidelines and a security policy.

## 0.1.0 (Pre-release) — 2026-04-24

- Initial pre-release
- 22 MCP tools: breakpoints, session control, stepping, variable inspection, editor navigation, workspace utilities
- Dual transport: VS Code `languageModelTools` + MCP stdio server
- Language-agnostic — works with any DAP-compatible debug adapter
